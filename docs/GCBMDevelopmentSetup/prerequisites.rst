GCBM Prerequisites
###################

Before we take a leap into the process of development, please take a moment to verify if you have the necessary tools setup and skills to get started on this project.
You should be familiar with the following:

Python 3.7
----------

This document will guide you through the steps for installing the Python 3.7 environment required for running the pre- and post-processing tools for GCBM.

If you already have Python installed on your computer, follow the instructions in the section `Existing Python Installation <#id1>`_ .

If Python is not already installed, follow the instructions in the section `New Python Installation <#id2>`_ .

Existing Python Installation
============================

* Locate your existing Python 3.7 installation (where python.exe is located). If you have both 32 and 64-bit versions installed (common with ArcGIS), find the path to the 64-bit version.
* From a command prompt in the ``python_3_installer`` directory, type:
  ``install_modules_only <python path>``

New Python Installation
=======================

* Verify that you have no existing Python 3.7 installation â€“ it is not usually possible to install the same version in two different locations.
* From a command prompt in the ``python_3_installer`` directory, type:
  ``install_python [optional install path]``

Microsoft Access Database Driver
--------------------------------

You may choose to skip this section if you have Microsoft Access installed.

If you do not have Microsoft Access installed, you will need to install a driver to connect to this type of database.

* Double-click ``python_3_installer\installers\AccessDatabaseEngine_x64.exe``
