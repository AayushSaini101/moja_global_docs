Outreach and Student Programs
=============================

moja global participates in outreach and student programs regularly to welcome and provide students and under-represented communities an opportunity to work with moja global.

In the past, weâ€™ve participated in programs like `Google Summer Of Code <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/>`_  (under DIAL), `Google Season Of Docs <https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs>`_ , `Linux Mentorship Programs <https://people.communitybridge.org/#projects>`_ and other funding and outreach programs.

Since we receive many applications through these programs, moja global encourages applicants to checkout the following guidelines to maximise chances of getting selected -

* Start early - It is encouraged for applicants to start early in the process to get a better understanding of the codebase and suggest new ideas.

* Get in touch with us - We would love to hear your project ideas and see how they align with our current codebase. Just drop an email at ``info@moja.global`` and we will get back to you.

* Make contributions - It is highly encouraged to make contributions to the existing repositories. Often the applicants selected are the ones who have made multiple contributions throughout the application period and have stayed consistent.

* Review peer contributions - Along with making contributions, it is also encouraged to help out other community members and applicants by providing peer reviews. Code reviews also help to get a deeper understanding of the codebase.

* Stay active on `Slack <https://mojaglobal.slack.com/>`_ - Being active and friendly on slack by answering queries asked by other new contributors is another quality that moja global values and can make your application stand out.

We wish you all the best in your journey!

Most of our outreach program Alums go on to act as maintainers for their projects and mentor other new contributors in their journey.

Due to limited slots while we can't ensure selection for these programs, if you are passionate to work on the project we will definitely try to find an alternative source of funding.
