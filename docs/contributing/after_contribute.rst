After making your first contribution

Get credit for your contribution
================================

We use the All Contributors Bot to recognize contributors.

To get recognized, just add the following line to a comment after making your contribution (like submitting a pull request, replying to a question, resolving an issue, etc.)
::
    @all-contributors please add <@username> for <contributions>

Replace ``<@username>`` with your GitHub username and ``<contributions>`` with any word from this `list <https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key>`_.

If you wish to know more about the ``all-contributors`` bot usage in moja global, please checkout the `Bots and Integrations section <../DeveloperWorkflow/bots_and_integrations.html>`_.

Report Bugs, Provide Feedback or Request Features
=================================================

We welcome all kinds of bug reports, user feedback and feature requests!

If you find an easily reproducible bug and/or are experienced in reporting bugs, feel free to just open an issue on the relevant project on GitHub.

We've created some issue templates to assist you in this. Please use them to create a `new issue <https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue>`_ in the relevant project's repository.

Pick more complex issues to work on
===================================

Now that you have your first contribution merged, you may move on to issues without ``Help for newcomers`` and ``Help Wanted`` labels. For specific areas of interest, please filter out the issues with specific labels of your interest.

Review other contributions
==========================

moja global welcomes all contributors to review each others pull requests and suggest changes. You may also choose to review other contributions by following this guide `here <../DeveloperWorkflow/reviewing.html>`_.
