How to make a code contribution
-------------------------------

Bug fixes, performance improvements, code formatting, ... There are a lot ways in which you can contribute code! The issues list of a project is a great place to find something that you can help us with.

To increase the chances of your code getting merged, please ensure that:

* You satisfy our `Code Contribution Best Practices <code_contribution_best_practices>`_..
* Your submission follows `Vincent Driessen's Git Branching System <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_.
* Your code's documentation follows our rules on `documenting your contribution <>`.

Your pull request:
* Passes all checks and has no conflicts.
* Has a well-written title and message that briefly explains your proposed changes.

NOTE: For FLINT please set the target branch of your pull request as `develop` instead of `master` since on FLINT the `develop` branch is the primary branch. For more details check out the `Git and Github guide <DevelopmentSetup/git_and_github_guide>`_.

Lastly, sign all your commits with a line like this:
::

This shows that you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). It certifies that you wrote (or otherwise have the right to submit) your contribution to the project.

How to Report Bugs, Provide Feedback or Request Features?
---------------------------------------------------------
We welcome all kinds of bug reports, user feedback and feature requests!

We've created some issue templates to assist you in this. Please use them to create a new issue in the relevant project's repository.

How to Review & Contribute Science Design?
------------------------------------------
Most of our code is informed by an underlying Science Design. We develop these designs collaboratively and your contributions are most welcome!

Every science-based project contains Science Designs under a directory named Science. There you can find:

PDFs that contain completed Science Designs.
Markdown (or .md) files that contain link to a Science Design document that is still under development.
For instructions on how to contribute Science Designs, please read this document.

How to Suggest UI/UX Improvements?
----------------------------------
One of the most important areas of improvement to our flagship software FLINT is the user interface. We really need your help with this!

If you have ideas on how we can improve, please share them with us by creating a new issue. We could then start a new project for your idea!

How to Contribute Translations?
-------------------------------
Right now our interfaces do not support translations and we also don't have a translation strategy in place. But we want to change this. We want our projects to be accessible to non-English speakers. If you have any ideas then please share them with us by creating a new issue.

Are There Other Ways of Contributing?
-------------------------------------
Yes, there are a lot of other ways in which you can help us!

You can coach new contributors, answer user questions, organize events, help us in administration, fundraising, website development, communication/outreach. You can also offer strategy advice. You can even join our strategy board!

If there's some other way, not listed above, in which you'd like to help, then please drop us a line at info@moja.global. We'll get in touch with you!
