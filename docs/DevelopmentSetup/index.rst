#################

This section guides first-time contributors through installing FLINT development environment on Windows and Ubuntu.

The recommended method for installing the FLINT development environment is on Windows using cmake, vcpkg and Visual Studio 2017 or 2019. Inorder to setup FLINT on Linux based systems, Docker containers are preferred. This method creates containers which are a simple way to build FLINT and all required dependencies.


**Before Setting Up FLINT**


- Please make sure that all the prerequisites required have been installed and configured correctly.
- The repository has been forked and cloned following the Git and Github guide `here <git_and_github_guide>`_ .
- It is highly recommended to first setup the FLINT.example repository to get an overview of how FLINT works since the software might seem a bit complex at first sight. The instructions for setting up FLINT.example repository can be found `here <FLINT.example_installation>`_.
